Xenial is the project name for a TensorFlow based Neural Network system. It is mostly a familiarization attempt with deep learning but may be expanded to cover a few areas of interest.
Something I am very much interested in is a personable personal assistant that can also hold a conversation through a text terminal.
Possible use cases could be as follows;
1. Personal Information Retention "Ask and ye shall recieve!"
2. Chat Bot capabilities
3. Reccomendations based on context and topic

A simple monolith with a basic screen and microphone for voice commands all housing a jetson based computer to run the AI companion. Responses will be relayed to the screen in a text style 
terminal answering basic questions.
